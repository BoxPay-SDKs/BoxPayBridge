        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        severity="Warning"
        message="Use version catalog instead"
        category="Productivity"
        priority="4"
        summary="Use TOML Version Catalog Instead"
        explanation="If your project is using a `libs.versions.toml` file, you should place all Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically)."
